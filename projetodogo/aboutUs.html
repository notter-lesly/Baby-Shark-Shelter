      <p>
        We are a couple of protectors who, loving animals so much, decided to
        dedicate our life to them, so in 1996, after thinking very carefully, we
        decided to be more active in protecting animals.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the money we had collected in more than 10 years of our computer
        technician jobs (she) and carpenter (he), we decided to buy land and
        build a sanctuary for animals.

      <p>
        Every day, after feeding the animals, we go out with our van through the
        streets of the city looking for injured or abandoned animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        After caring, feeding and treating, as we cannot be with everyone, we
        castrate and put the animal up for adoption. If you are interested in
        adopting, consult the link "animals" and, schedule a visit through the
        form "contact us"
