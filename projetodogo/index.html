    <h2>DOGS</h2>

    <p>
      There are a lot of reasons to have a dog or a cat. Pets come with some
      powerful mental health benefits. Caring for a dog or cat can help you cope
      with depression, anxiety, and stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent research about the canine-human relationship shows that owning a
      dog is actually good for you on both physical and emotional levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dog owners are more likely to have a healthy heart. In fact, some research
      has shown that dog owners are much more likely to survive a heart attack
      compared to non-dog owners. Male pet owners in particular tend to
      experience a reduced rate of heart disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog’s amazing sense of smell can be used for a variety of purposes,
      including cancer detection. Many dog owners have reported their dog
      sniffing, licking, or nudging spots that later turned out to be cancerous.
      One of the unexpected benefits of having a dog is that it may even save
      your life by helping you to detect cancer.

    <h2>CATS</h2>
    <p>
      Studies have found that owning a cat can lower your stress levels, which
      in turn will have a knock-on effect on your risk of cardiovascular
      disease. Owning a cat can actually lower ones risk of various heart
      diseases, including stroke, by around 30 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cat purring is one of the most comforting sounds in the world and while
      it certainly means your cat is happy and comfortable, the sound has also
      been long associated with a therapeutic healing ability on human bones and
      muscle.
    </p>

    <p>
      A cats purr creates vibrations at a frequency of 20-140 HZ, and studies
      have shown that frequencies in the 18-35 HZ range have a positive effect
      on joint mobility after injury, scientists have begun talking about how
      the cat noise could help humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a cat around you can actually trigger the release of calming
      chemicals in your body which lower your stress and anxiety leves. Cats are
      known for being super low-maintencance and a simple petting session is
      usually enough to make both you and your cat7 happy.

    <h2>DOG OR CAT?</h2>

    <h3>WHATEVER!</h3>

    <ol>
      STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT:
    </ol>
    <li>
      pet owners are less likely to suffer from depression than those without
      pets.
    </li>
    <li>
      People with pets have lower blood pressure in stressful situations than
      those without pets. One study even found that when people with borderline
      hypertension adopted dogs from a shelter, their blood pressure declined
      significantly within five months.
    </li>
    <li>
      Playing with a dog or cat can elevate levels of serotonin and dopamine,
      which calm and relax.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pet owners have lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels (indicators of
      heart disease) than those without pets.
    </li>
    <li>Heart attack patients with pets survive longer than those without.</li>
    <li>
      Pet owners over age 65 make 30 percent fewer visits to their doctors than
      those without pets.
    </li>
    <li>
      While people with pets often experience the greatest health benefits, a
      pet doesn’t necessarily have to be a dog or a cat. Even watching fish in
      an aquarium can help reduce muscle tension and lower pulse rate.
